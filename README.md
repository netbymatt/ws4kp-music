## How they were made

This music was generated with [Suno.ai](https://suno.ai). The full process started with looking up playlist of what was played on the Weather Channel in the 90's. The group at [TWC Classics](https://twcclassics.com/audio/years-1991.html) has thuroughly documented this. I then used names of the artists in prompts to a large language model (ChatGPT) such as "describe the music of Spyro Gyra".

Finally, I used the descriptions of the artists and picked out key words that describe the music to feed to the generator at suno.ai. I sprinkled in a few weather weather-terms as well. I passed on a few of the outputs, but the majority had the right vibe and ended up in this repo. Here are a few example prompts:
- Jazz flute played over a samba bass line, with the vibe of a spring shower
- Saxophone melody with synth hits in a mellow vibe with a moderate tempo
- Jazz fusion with synth guitar and drums that evokes thoughts of winter snowfall
- Smooth jazz for a cool and sunny day
